    "abstract": "<p>This paper is motivated by seeking lower bounds on \\(\\mathrm{OBDD}(\\land, \\mathrm{weakening}, \\mathrm{reordering})\\) refutations, namely OBDD refutations that allow weakening and arbitrary reorderings. We first work with \\(1\\text{-}\\mathrm{NBP}(\\land)\\) refutations based on read-once nondeterministic branching programs. These generalize \\(\\mathrm{OBDD}(\\land, \\mathrm{reordering})\\) refutations. There are polynomial size \\(1\\text{-}\\mathrm{NBP}(\\land)\\) refutations of the pigeonhole principle, hence \\(1\\text{-}\\mathrm{NBP}(\\land)\\) is strictly stronger than \\(\\mathrm{OBDD}(\\land, \\mathrm{reordering})\\). There are also formulas that have polynomial size tree-like resolution refutations but require exponential size \\(1\\text{-}\\mathrm{NBP}(\\land)\\) refutations. As a corollary, \\(\\mathrm{OBDD}(\\land, \\mathrm{reordering})\\)does not simulate tree-like resolution, answering a previously open question.</p><p>The system \\(1\\text{-}\\mathrm{NBP}(\\land, \\exists)\\) uses projection inferences instead of weakening. \\(1\\text{-}\\mathrm{NBP}(\\land, \\exists_k)\\) is the system restricted to projection on at most \\(k\\) distinct variables. We construct explicit constant degree graphs \\(G_n\\) on \\(n\\) vertices and an \\(\\epsilon > 0\\), such that \\(1\\text{-}\\mathrm{NBP}(\\land, \\exists_{\\epsilon n})\\) refutations of the Tseitin formula for \\(G_n\\) require exponential size.</p><p>Second, we study the proof system \\(\\mathrm{OBDD}(\\land, \\mathrm{weakening}, \\mathrm{reordering}_\\ell)\\) which allows \\(\\ell\\) different variable orders in a refutation. We prove an exponential lower bound on the complexity of tree-like \\(\\mathrm{OBDD}(\\land, \\mathrm{weakening}, \\mathrm{reordering}_\\ell)\\) refutations for \\(\\ell = \\epsilon \\log n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of variables and \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) is a constant. The lower bound is based on multiparty communication complexity."

    "abstract": "A hitting formula is a set of Boolean clauses such that any two of the clauses cannot be simultaneously falsified. Hitting formulas have been studied in many different contexts at least since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1137/0218026\">[Iwama, 1989]</a> and, based on experimental evidence, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15225\">[Peitl and Szeider, 2022]</a> conjectured that unsatisfiable hitting formulas are among the hardest for resolution.Using the fact that hitting formulas are easy to check for satisfiability we make them the foundation of a new static proof system Hitting: a refutation of a CNF in Hitting is an unsatisfiable hitting formula such that each of its clauses is a weakening of a clause of the refuted CNF. Comparing this system to resolution and other proof systems is equivalent to studying the hardness of hitting formulas. Our first result is that Hitting is quasi-polynomially simulated by tree-like resolution, which means that hitting formulas cannot be exponentially hard for resolution and partially refutes the conjecture of Peitl and Szeider. We show that tree-like resolution and Hitting are quasi-polynomially separated, while for resolution, this question remains open. For a system that is only quasi-polynomially stronger than tree-like resolution, Hitting is surprisingly difficult to <it>polynomially</it> simulate in another proof system. Using the ideas of Raz-Shpilka's polynomial identity testing for noncommutative circuits <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00037-005-0188-8\">[Raz, Shpilka, 2005]</a> we show that Hitting is p-simulated by Extended Frege, but we conjecture that much more efficient simulations exist. As a byproduct, we show that a number of static (semi)algebraic systems are verifiable in deterministic polynomial time."

Our proof is an application of robust sunflowers and block unpredictability."

This extends  Hastad's recent lower bound for the grid graph to any graph. Furthermore, we prove tightness of our bound up to a multiplicative constant in the top exponent. Namely, we show that if a Tseitin formula for a graph \\(G\\) has size \\(s\\), then for all large enough \\(d\\), it has a depth \\(d\\) Frege proof of size \\(2^{\\mathrm{tw}(G)^{O(1/d)}} \\mathrm{poly}(s)\\). Through this result we settle a question posed by  <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00037-011-0029-x\">[Alekhnovich, Razborov, 2011]</a> about the efficient search for resolution proofs of Tseitin formulas over any graph."

Mahmoody, Smith and Wu (ICALP 2020) prove that VDFs satisfying both perfect completeness and adaptive perfect uniqueness do not exist in the random oracle model. Moreover, Ephraim, Freitag, Komargodski, and Pass  (EUROCRYPT 2020) construct a VDF with perfect completeness and computational uniqueness, a much weaker guarantee compare to perfect uniqueness, in the random oracle model under the repeated squaring assumption. In this work, we close the gap between existing constructions and known lower bounds by showing that VDFs with imperfect completeness and non-adaptive computational uniqueness cannot be constructed in the pure random oracle model (without additional computational assumptions)."
