        "abstract": "Suppose we have a two-party communication protocol for $f$ which allows the parties to make queries to an oracle computing $g$; for example, they may query an Equality oracle. To translate this protocol into a randomized protocol, we must replace the oracle with a randomized subroutine for solving $g$. If q queries are made, the standard technique requires that we boost the error of each subroutine down to $O(1/q)$, leading to communication complexity which grows as $q \\log q$. For which oracles $g$ can this naive boosting technique be improved? We focus on the oracles which can be computed by constant-cost randomized protocols, and show that the naive boosting strategy can be improved for the Equality oracle but not the 1-Hamming Distance oracle. Two surprising consequences are (1) a new example of a problem where the cost of computing $k$ independent copies grows superlinear in $k$, drastically simplifying the only previous example due to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01020\">[Blais, Brody 2019]</a>; and (2) a new proof that Equality is not complete for the class of constant-cost randomized communication <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03639\">[Harms, Wild, Zamaraev, 2022]</a>; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11856-022-2365-8\">[Hambardzumyan, Hatami, Hatami, 2022]</a>."

Hitting formulas have been studied in many different contexts at least since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1137/0218026\">[Iwama, 1989]</a> and, based on experimental evidence, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15225\">[Peitl and Szeider, 2022]</a> conjectured that unsatisfiable hitting formulas are among the hardest for resolution.Using the fact that hitting formulas are easy to check for satisfiability we make them the foundation of a new static proof system Hitting: a refutation of a CNF in Hitting is an unsatisfiable hitting formula such that each of its clauses is a weakening of a clause of the refuted CNF. Comparing this system to resolution and other proof systems is equivalent to studying the hardness of hitting formulas. Our first result is that Hitting is quasi-polynomially simulated by tree-like resolution, which means that hitting formulas cannot be exponentially hard for resolution and partially refutes the conjecture of Peitl and Szeider. We show that tree-like resolution and Hitting are quasi-polynomially separated, while for resolution, this question remains open. For a system that is only quasi-polynomially stronger than tree-like resolution, Hitting is surprisingly difficult to <it>polynomially</it> simulate in another proof system. Using the ideas of Raz-Shpilka's polynomial identity testing for noncommutative circuits <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00037-005-0188-8\">[Raz, Shpilka, 2005]</a> we show that Hitting is p-simulated by Extended Frege, but we conjecture that much more efficient simulations exist. As a byproduct, we show that a number of static (semi)algebraic systems are verifiable in deterministic polynomial time."

Moreover, Ephraim, Freitag, Komargodski, and Pass  (EUROCRYPT 2020) construct a VDF with perfect completeness and computational uniqueness, a much weaker guarantee compare to perfect uniqueness, in the random oracle model under the repeated squaring assumption. In this work, we close the gap between existing constructions and known lower bounds by showing that VDFs with imperfect completeness and non-adaptive computational uniqueness cannot be constructed in the pure random oracle model (without additional computational assumptions)."

This shows, for instance, that Bazzi's celebrated result (k-wise independence fools DNFs) cannot be generalised in a natural way. We also propose a way to circumvent our counterexample: We define a new notion of pseudorandomness called local couplings and show that it fools DNFs and even decision lists."
