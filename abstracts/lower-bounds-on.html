<p>This paper is motivated by seeking lower bounds on \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land, \mathrm{weakening}, 
    \mathrm{reordering})\) refutations, namely OBDD refutations that allow weakening and arbitrary reorderings.
     We first work with \(1\text{-}\mathrm{NBP}(\land)\) refutations based on read-once nondeterministic
      branching programs. These generalize \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land, \mathrm{reordering})\) refutations.
       There are polynomial size \(1\text{-}\mathrm{NBP}(\land)\) refutations of the pigeonhole principle,
        hence \(1\text{-}\mathrm{NBP}(\land)\) is strictly stronger than \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land,
         \mathrm{reordering})\). There are also formulas that have polynomial size tree-like resolution
          refutations but require exponential size \(1\text{-}\mathrm{NBP}(\land)\) refutations. 
          As a corollary, \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land, \mathrm{reordering})\)does not simulate tree-like resolution,
           answering a previously open question.</p><p>The system \(1\text{-}\mathrm{NBP}(\land, \exists)\) 
            uses projection inferences instead of weakening. \(1\text{-}\mathrm{NBP}(\land, \exists_k)\) is
             the system restricted to projection on at most \(k\) distinct variables. We construct explicit
              constant degree graphs \(G_n\) on \(n\) vertices and an \(\epsilon > 0\), such that
               \(1\text{-}\mathrm{NBP}(\land, \exists_{\epsilon n})\) refutations of the Tseitin formula
                for \(G_n\) require exponential size.</p><p>Second, we study the proof system 
                    \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land, \mathrm{weakening}, \mathrm{reordering}_\ell)\) which 
                    allows \(\ell\) different variable orders in a refutation. We prove an exponential
                     lower bound on the complexity of tree-like \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land, \mathrm{weakening},
                     \mathrm{reordering}_\ell)\) refutations for \(\ell = \epsilon \log n\), where \(n\) is
                      the number of variables and \(\epsilon > 0\) is a constant. The lower bound is based
                       on multiparty communication complexity.
