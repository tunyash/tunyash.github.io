We introduce a propositional proof system based on decision trees utilizing symmetries of formulas. We refer to this proof system as decision trees with symmetries (SDT). SDT can be polynomially simulated by the proof system SR-I introduced by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00265682">[Krishnamurthy, 1985]</a>; SR-I  extends Resolution with the symmetry rule. We show that there are polynomial-size proofs of the functional pigeonhole principle \(\mathrm{FPHP}_n^{n+1}\) and of an encoding of the clique coloring principle. On the other hand we show that any SDT for the pigeonhole principle \(\mathrm{PHP}_n^{n+1}\) has size \(2^{n^{1/3-o(1)}}\) despite that the pigeonhole principle has a lot of symmetries.
