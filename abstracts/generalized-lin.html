<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1806689.1806711">Aaronson (STOC 2010)</a> conjectured that almost k-wise independence fools constant-depth circuits; 
he called this the generalised Linial-Nisan conjecture. Aaronson himself later found a counterexample
 for depth-3 circuits. We give here an improved counterexample for depth-2 circuits (DNFs). This shows,
  for instance, that Bazzi's celebrated result (k-wise independence fools DNFs) cannot be generalised 
  in a natural way. We also propose a way to circumvent our counterexample: We define a new notion of
   pseudorandomness called local couplings and show that it fools DNFs and even decision lists.
