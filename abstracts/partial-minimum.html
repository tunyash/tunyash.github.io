We show that assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, the Partial Minimum Branching Program Size 
Problem (MBPSP*) requires superpolynomial time. This result also applies to the partial minimization
 problems for many interesting subclasses of branching programs, such as read-k branching programs and OBDDs.
  Combining these results with our recent result <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20624-5_38">Glinskih and Riazanov (LATIN 2022)</a> we obtain an unconditional
   superpolynomial lower bound on the size of Read-Once Nondeterministic Branching Programs (1-NBP) computing
    the total versions of the minimum BP, read-k-BP, and OBDD size problems. Additionally we show that
     it is NP-hard to check whether a given BP computing a partial Boolean function can be compressed to a 
     BP of a given size.
