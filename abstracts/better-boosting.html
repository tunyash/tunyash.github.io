Suppose we have a two-party communication protocol for \(f\) which allows the parties to make queries to an oracle 
computing \(g\); for example, they may query an Equality oracle. To translate this protocol into a randomized protocol,
 we must replace the oracle with a randomized subroutine for solving \(g\). If q queries are made, the standard technique
  requires that we boost the error of each subroutine down to \(O(1/q)\), leading to communication complexity which grows
   as \(q \log q\). For which oracles \(g\) can this naive boosting technique be improved? We focus on the oracles which can
   be computed by a low-depth circuit. We show that for such oracles the naive boosting technique can be improved. Our main
     results are: (1) a new example of a problem where the cost of computing \(k\) independent copies grows superlinear in \(k\),
      and (2) a new separation between lifting theorems and direct sum theorems for randomized communication complexity.
