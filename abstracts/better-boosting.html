Suppose we have a two-party communication protocol for $f$ which allows the parties to make queries to an oracle 
computing $g$; for example, they may query an Equality oracle. To translate this protocol into a randomized protocol,
 we must replace the oracle with a randomized subroutine for solving $g$. If q queries are made, the standard technique
  requires that we boost the error of each subroutine down to $O(1/q)$, leading to communication complexity which grows
   as $q \log q$. For which oracles $g$ can this naive boosting technique be improved? We focus on the oracles which can
    be computed by constant-cost randomized protocols, and show that the naive boosting strategy can be improved for the
     Equality oracle but not the 1-Hamming Distance oracle. Two surprising consequences are 
     (1) a new example of a problem where the cost of computing $k$ independent copies grows superlinear in $k$,
      drastically simplifying the only previous example due to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01020">[Blais, Brody 2019]</a>; and
 (2) a new proof that Equality is not complete for the class of constant-cost randomized communication
