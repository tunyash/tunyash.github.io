Suppose we are given an infinite sequence of input cells, each initialized with a uniform random 
symbol from \([n]\). How hard is it to output a sequence in [n]n that is close to a uniform random
 permutation? <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/viola/papers/sampling-lower-bounds.pdf">Viola (SICOMP 2020)</a> conjectured that if each output cell is computed by making
  \(d\) probes to input cells, then \(d\ge \omega(1)\). Our main result shows that, in fact,
   \(d\ge (\log n)^{\Omega(1)}\), which  is tight up to the constant in the exponent. 
   Our techniques also show that if the probes are nonadaptive, then \(d \ge n^{\Omega(1)}\), 
   which is an exponential improvement over the previous nonadaptive lower bound due to 
   <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2024.100">Yu and Zhan (ITCS 2024)</a>. Our results also imply lower bounds against succinct data
    structures for storing permutations.
