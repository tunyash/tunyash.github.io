We show that the perfect matching function on \(n\)-vertex graphs requires monotone circuits of size \(\smash{2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}}\). This improves on the  \(n^{\Omega(\log n)}\) lower bound  of Razborov (1985). Our proof uses the standard approximation method together with a new sunflower lemma for matchings.
