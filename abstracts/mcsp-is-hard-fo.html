<p>We show that every read-once nondeterministic branching program computing the Minimum Circuit Size Problem 
    on inputs of length \(N\) has size \(\Omega(N^{\log\log(N)})\). This is the first superpolynomial lower 
    bound on the size of a read-once branching program computing MCSP. This lower bound is tight for the
     version of MCSP restricted to a linear circuit size parameter.</p><p> To show this result we adapt 
    a conditional lower bound of  <a href="https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2020/183/">[Ilango, 2020]</a> 
    on the deterministic Turing Machine time complexity of computing \(\mathrm{MCSP}^{*}\), the generalization
     of MCSP to partial functions. In contrast, our lower bound is unconditional and holds even for the total
      MCSP function. </p>
