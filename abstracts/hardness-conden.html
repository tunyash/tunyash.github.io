<p>Can every \(n\)-bit boolean function with deterministic query complexity \(k\ll n\) be restricted to \(O(k)\) variables such that the query complexity remains \(\Omega(k)\)? That is, can query complexity be <it>condensed</it> via restriction? We study such hardness condensation questions in both query and communication complexity, proving two main results.</p><ul><li> <b>Negative:</b> Query complexity <it>cannot</it> be condensed in general: There is a function \(f\) with query complexity \(k\) such that any restriction of \(f\) to \(O(k)\) variables has query complexity \(O(k^{3/4})\).</li><li><b> Positive:</b> Randomised communication complexity can be condensed for the <it>sink-of-xor</it> function. This yields a quantitatively improved counterexample to the log-approximate-rank conjecture, achieving parameters conjectured by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02717">[Chattopadhyay, Garg, and Sherif, 2021]</a>.</li> </ul>Along the way we show the existence of <it>Shearer extractors</it> --- a new type of seeded extractor whose output bits satisfy prescribed dependencies across distinct seeds.
