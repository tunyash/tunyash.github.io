We prove that the size of any regular resolution refutation of a Tseitin formula \(\mathrm{Ts}(G,c)\) based 
on a connected graph \(G=(V,E)\) is at least \(2^{\Omega(\mathrm{tw}(G)/\log |V|)}\), where \(\mathrm{tw}(G)\) denotes 
the treewidth of a graph \(G\). For constant-degree graphs there is known upper bound \(2^{O(\mathrm{tw}(G))}\mathrm{poly}(|V|)\)

<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3378667">[Galesi, Talebanfard, Torán 2020]</a>, so our lower bound is tight up 
to a logarithmic factor in the exponent.
