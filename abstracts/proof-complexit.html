We show two communication lower bounds on the clause search problem \(\mathrm{Search}_\phi\), the problem is given an assignment to the variables of an unsatisfiable CNF \(\phi\) find a clause \(C \in \phi\) that is falsified by the assignment. The first lower bound is on the 2-party communication cost of \(\mathrm{Search}_\phi\) with \(\phi\) encoding the perfect matching principle over the graph \(K_{n,n+2}\), the second is a on the number-on-forehead communication complexity of \(\mathrm{Search}_\phi\) where \(\phi\) is the bitwise encoding of the pigeonhole principle. These communication lower bounds imply several interesting proof complexity lower bounds that seemed unattainable via communication reductions.
