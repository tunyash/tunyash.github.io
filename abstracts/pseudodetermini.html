We exhibit an \(n\)-bit partial function with randomized communication complexity \(O(\log n)\) but such that any completion of this function into a total one requires randomized communication complexity \(n^{\Omega(1)}\). In particular, this shows an exponential separation between randomized and <it>pseudodeterministic</it> communication protocols. Previously, Gavinsky (2025) showed an analogous separation in the weaker model of parity decision trees. We use lifting techniques to extend his proof idea to communication complexity.
