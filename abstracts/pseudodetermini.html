We exhibit an \(n\)-bit partial function with randomized communication complexity \(O(\log n)\) but such
 that any completion of this function into a total one requires randomized communication complexity
  \(n^{\Omega(1)}\). In particular, this shows an exponential separation between randomized and
   <it>pseudodeterministic</it> communication protocols. Previously, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/rsa.70010">Gavinsky (2025)</a> showed an 
   analogous separation in the weaker model of parity decision trees. 
   We use lifting techniques to extend his proof idea to communication complexity.
