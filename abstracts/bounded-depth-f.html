We prove that there is a constant \(K\) such that <it>Tseitin</it> formulas for an undirected graph \(G\) requires proofs of size \(2^{\mathrm{tw}(G)^{\Omega(1/d)}}\) in depth \(d\) Frege systems for \(d<\frac{K \log n}{\log \log n}\), where \(\mathrm{tw}(G)\) is the treewidth of \(G\). This extends  Hastad's recent lower bound for the grid graph to any graph. Furthermore, we prove tightness of our bound up to a multiplicative constant in the top exponent. Namely, we show that if a Tseitin formula for a graph \(G\) has size \(s\), then for all large enough \(d\), it has a depth \(d\) Frege proof of size \(2^{\mathrm{tw}(G)^{O(1/d)}} \mathrm{poly}(s)\). Through this result we settle a question posed by  <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00037-011-0029-x">[Alekhnovich, Razborov, 2011]</a> about the efficient search for resolution proofs of Tseitin formulas over any graph.
