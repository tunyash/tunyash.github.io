We consider a subclass of AC\(^0[2]\) circuits that simultaneously captures DNF\(\circ\)Xor and depth-\(3\) AC\(^0\) circuits. For this class we show a technique for proving lower bounds inspired by the top-down approach. We give lower bounds for the middle slice function, inner product function, and affine dispersers.
