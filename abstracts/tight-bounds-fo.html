We show that for any connected graph \(G\) the size of any regular resolution or
 \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land, \mathrm{reordering})\) refutation of a Tseitin formula based on \(G\) 
 is at least \(2^{\Omega(\mathrm{tw}(G))}\), where \(\mathrm{tw}(G)\) is the treewidth of \(G\). 
 These lower bounds improve upon the previously known bounds and, moreover, they are tight.
