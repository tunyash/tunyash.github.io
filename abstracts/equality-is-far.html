We exhibit an \(n\)-bit communication problem with a constant-cost randomized protocol but which requires
 \(n^{\Omega(1)}\) deterministic (or even non-deterministic) queries to an Equality oracle. Therefore,
  even constant-cost randomized protocols cannot be efficiently "derandomized" using Equality oracles.
   This improves on several recent results and answers a question from the survey of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14623">Hatami and Hatami 
    (SIGACT News 2024)</a>. It also gives a significantly simpler and quantitatively superior proof of the 
    main result of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3717823.3718129">Fang, Göös, Harms, and Hatami (STOC 2025)</a>, that constant-cost communication does 
    not reduce to the \(k\)-Hamming Distance hierarchy.
