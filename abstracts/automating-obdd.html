We prove that the proof system  \(\mathrm{OBDD}(\land, \mathrm{weakening})\) is not automatable unless P=NP. The proof is based upon the celebrated result of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3409472">[Atserias, Muller 2019]</a> about the hardness of automatability  for resolution. The heart of the proof is lifting with multi-output indexing gadget from resolution block-width to dag-like multiparty number-in-hand communication protocol size with \(o(n)\) parties, where \(n\) is the number of variables in the non-lifted formula. A similar lifting theorem for protocols with \(n+1\) participants was proved by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08037">[Göös, Koroth, Mertz, Pitassi, 2020]</a> to establish the hardness of automatability result for Cutting Planes.
